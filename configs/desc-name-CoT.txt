First, using the information provided above, describe the function and/or structure of the protein family. Start your response with "Description: " and continue response in the same string. Do not use any additional markdown characters. The description should have following properties:
* The description must use 200 words or less.
* The description must start with 'This protein family'.
* The description must be a good generalization of the information, and not provide too many details.
* If the descriptions uses a statement from a gene summary that is followed by a citation in square brackets, you must use the same citation in your response.
* Identifiers must be cited in square brackets, for example: [PMC10000000_0], [PMC12345678_9].
* Each identifier must be in separate square brackets.
* Multiple citations must be seperated by commas.
* Do not put anything else in square brackets.
* You can only cite the identifiers that were present in gene summaries. 
* Try to put these citations after each sentence.

Secondly, using the information provided above, you need to generate a name and a short name for this family. They should each be in a seperate line starting with "Name: " and "Short name: " respectively. Do not use any additional markdown characters. Suggest 3 pairs of name and short name. Name and short name should have following properties:
* name: name for the family in 100 characters or less
* short_name: short name of the family in 30 characters or less, only alphanumeric characters as well as digits, and the following special characters: /_-+().':
You need to follow these riles:
* The name and short name must not end with 'fam', or 'family'.
* The name and short name must not end with 'super', or 'superfamily'.
* The name and short name must not contain any taxonomic information.
* The name and short name must not contain 'proteins', 'families', or 'subunits'.
* If the name contains 'domain-containing', it must be followed by 'protein', i.e. 'domain-containing protein'.
* The name and short name must not contain repetitions, e.g. "Nectin and Nectin-like" must be replaced by "Nectin-like".
* The name must not contain underscores unless it is part of a gene name.
Here are some examples of names and short names to help you generating the short name:
* Ribosomal protein S1-like -> Ribosomal_protein_S1-like
* Retinoid X receptor/HNF4 -> Retinoid-X_rcpt/HNF4
* Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C -> AKR1C
* Transmembrane protein 230/134 -> TMEM_230/134
* A-kinase anchor protein 6/Centrosomal protein of 68kDa > AKAP6/CEP68
* Geranylgeranyl transferase type-1 subunit beta -> GGTase_I_beta
* Prion protein -> Prion
